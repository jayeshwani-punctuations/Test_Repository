# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to think, learn, and solve problems. AI systems use algorithms, data, and computational power to perform tasks such as speech recognition, image analysis, decision-making, and language translation. Common AI techniques include machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. AI is widely used in healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and entertainment. It powers virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. As AI continues to evolve, it aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and innovation while raising important ethical and societal considerations about its responsible use.
